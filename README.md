# Empirical Analysis of Sampling methods on Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced data refers to uneven distribution of classes within a data-set. It occurs when one class has comparatively more observations than others.Due to this imbalance in the data-set, the trained model shall be biased over majority class. In order to overcome this bias, and to train a balanced dataset,we have used several sampling methods to balance the dataset and have compared the results.

## Design

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preparation
3. Choose a model
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Parameter Tuning
7. Make Predictions

## Installation

[Python](https://www.python.org//) v3.7.0+ is required, to run.

Install the libraries.

```sh
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install imblearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
```
## Development

These are the steps to run after opening a terminal:

Step 1:

```sh
Load and Read dataset
```

Step 2:

```sh
Split dataset into train and test
```

Step 3:

```sh
Apply regression model and check results
```
Step 4:

```sh
Apply and run sampling methods on the training dataset
```
Step 5:

```sh
Apply regression model on sampled dataset and compare results.
```
